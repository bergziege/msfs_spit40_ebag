## Electronic Flight Bag

This project creates a custom toolbar in Microsoft Flight Simulator that allows you to view any PDFs, JPGs and TXT files off your PC. It bundles a very small local web browser by RitaLabs called tinyweb.exe and uses open source ghostscript to convert PDFs to JPG images which MSFS can read. Then just a little HTML to navigate them.


Think I'll just leave this markdown documentation here

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/spit40/msfs_spit40_ebag/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
